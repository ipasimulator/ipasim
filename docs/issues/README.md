# Issues and tags

We use a concept of *issues*. They are contained in folder `/docs/issues/` and
can be referenced from code by `i` and number, e.g., `i1`. (This convention is
used since July 2019 when the project was published to GitHub. Before that date,
we used hashtag and number, e.g. `#1`. We changed this convention to distinguish
our issues and GitHub issues.)

Before we started using issues, we also used *tags*, i.e., unique short
identifiers that were referenced from code and documented elsewhere. Below are
documented those that can still be found in code.

- `[docker-script]`: This script is referenced from `Dockerfile`. It's not meant
  to be run manually.

## TAPI

TAPI sources are located in `/deps/tapi/`.

- `[must-quote]`: Changed `bool` -> `QuotingType`,
  `false` -> `QuotingType::None`, `true` -> `QuotingType::Double`.  LLVM API
  probably evolved.
- `[no-dynamic]`: `ObjCProperty` does not contain method `isDynamic` and it
  seems it never did.
- `[sort]`: Inspired by
  [Swift's `TBDGen`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/2f4e70bf7f4eee43bfb2f24d6215eb1f63c05d01/lib/TBDGen/tapi/TextStub_v3.cpp#L189).
- `[no-cmake]`: In the original code, this was built with CMake. But we don't
  use CMake, so we crafted it manually.

## WinObjC

WinObjC sources are located in `/deps/WinObjC/`.

- `[objc-class]` - We replace `_OBJC_CLASS__NSCF...` symbol references (those
  were generated by the GNUstep runtime) with `OBJC_CLASS_$__NSCF...` symbol
  references (which are generated by our Apple-like runtime).
- `[class-symbols]` - Changed `_OBJC_CLASS_*` to `OBJC_CLASS_$_*` and
  `__objc_class_name_*` to `OBJC_METACLASS_$_*`. This reflects the difference
  between how our runtime and the GNUstep runtime name those symbols. Although
  symbols `__objc_class_name_*` and `OBJC_METACLASS_$_*` probably doesn't mean
  the same thing, we only replace those symbols in `.def` files so it only
  causes them to be exported which is exactly what we want. Note that this "tag"
  is not actually used, because it would be virtually in every `.def` file
  inside `/deps/WinObjC/build/`. **TODO: Write a script that will do this
  automatically (without the need for manually changing those `.def` files).**
- `[ehtype]` - So that it is not an error to have multiple occurrences of symbol
  `_OBJC_EHTYPE_$_NSException`. **TODO: Instead make `clang` to not generate
  those symbols.**
- `[no-nsobject]` - `NSObject` is implemented in our runtime, so we disabled it
  in WinObjC's `Foundation` framework.
- `[uikit-autolayout]` - There is a circular dependency between projects
  `AutoLayout` and `UIKit`.

## Objective-C runtime

See [its documentation](../../src/objc/README.md).

## LLVM

LLVM's sources are located in `/deps/llvm/`, `/deps/clang/`, `/deps/lld/` and
`/deps/lldb/`.

- `[ipasim-objc-runtime]`: We are adding a new runtime called `ipasim` that
  derives from the `ios` runtime and introduces changes that the `microsoft`
  runtime introduced.
- `[dllimport]`: See section "Objective-C symbols across DLLs".
- `[mhdr]`: We are patching linker (`lld-link`) to add a section named `.mhdr`
  which will contain Mach-O header. This Mach-O header will then be used by our
  `libobjc` to initialize the image.
- `[fixbind]`: See `[dllimport]` - we are fixing some symbols to use
  `__declspec(dllimport)` semantics, but that introduces another level of
  indirection in data pointers. Unfortunately, Windows loader cannot bind
  symbols directly, so we need to fix those bindings at runtime. In Clang, we
  create a new section called `.fixbind` which contains addresses to all the
  bindings that need to be fixed. At runtime, we then fix those addresses in our
  `dyld`.
- `[pretty-print]`: We improved pretty printing of functions to match our needs
  in `HeadersAnalyzer`.
- `[emit-all-decls]`: See
  [`HeadersAnalyzer`](../../src/HeadersAnalyzer/README.md).
- `[irt]`: We renamed folder `InstrumentationRuntime` to `IRt` because the
  former was too long for Windows. **TODO: Obviously, don't do this. Rather move
  our sources near the root (e.g., `C:\src\`). But then also mention that in
  build instructions.**
- `[macho]`: We want to read Mach-O object files on Windows, too. Alternative to
  this would be to emit PE/COFF instead, or just DWARF (`-gsplit-dwarf`). Then,
  we wouldn't have to read Mach-O object files.
- `[no-lsystem]`: We added option `-no_lsystem` which, when used, tells Clang
  driver not to pass option `-lSystem` to linker. We use this option inside our
  `HeadersAnalyzer` to generate `.dylib`s on Windows (where is no
  `libSystem.dylib` for linker to use).
- `[emit-bodies]`: We don't want to emit bodies in our `HeadersAnalyzer` since
  we are only interested in declarations. So we added and used this option to
  speed up the compilation by skipping body emission. If ever pushed upstream,
  this should be changed to emit just declarations, though. Because now it emits
  invalid almost-empty definitions.

## LIEF

LIEF's sources are located in `/deps/LIEF/`.

- `[lief-mt]`: We link LIEF statically, because we need only substantial portion
  of it. But UWP apps need to link to CRT dynamically, so we need to use `/MD`
  compiler option instead of `/MT`.
