# `#22`: [uwp] LIEF maps `library_ordinal` to wrong `library`

## Problem

If Dylib contains command `LC_ID_DYLIB`, LIEF parses it as `DylibCommand` (see
`BinaryParser.tcc`). Thanks to that, `Binary::libraries` returns it as one of
binary's libraries. But, inside `BinaryParser::do_bind`, those libraries are
indexed by `library_ordinal`. That's a problem, because library's ordinal should
only index over other libraries and `LC_ID_DYLIB` refers to the current library.

Effectively, this sometimes causes wrong library to be assigned to wrong
`BindingInfo`s.

## Solution

We simply filter `LC_ID_DYLIB`s out of `Binary::libraries`.
