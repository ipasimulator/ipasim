# `#12`: [llvm] Bug in `lld-link`

## Problem

Just link `tapi` with our version of `clang -fuse-ld=lld-link`. You'll get this:

```
LLVM ERROR: out of memory
```

## Cause

See
[source of `llvm::report_bad_alloc_error`](http://llvm.org/doxygen/ErrorHandling_8cpp_source.html#l00171).
From that it seems that we do some bad memory allocation in our patch code.
