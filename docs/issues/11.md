# `#11`: [woc] Circular dependency between UIKit and AutoLayout

## Problem

See also [`[uikit-autolayout]`](../winobjc.md).

## Solution

We unreferenced AutoLayout from UIKit (it wasn't useful reference anyway - see
`UIView.mm`). We had to reference UIKit from AutoLayout, though. **TODO: This
reference wasn't in AutoLayout's `.vcxproj`s originally, how is that possible?**
