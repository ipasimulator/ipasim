# `#9`: [woc] Building XAML pages

## Problem

Building UWP XAML pages (e.g., `MainPage.xaml`) is fairly complicated. More so
if it's a C++ app. See
[Microsoft's blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2012/08/24/connecting-c-and-xaml/)
for more details. We cannot really build it using only compiler, even if it's
Microsoft's CL.exe. Generating files is also needed and commands that generate
them are not known (it's probably some MSBuild magic).

## Possible solutions

We could write CMake code to generate needed intermediate files and compile them
into resulting `.obj`. That would require undocumented knowledge, though.
Alternatively, we could use MSBuild to build projects containing XAML pages for
us. See also [issue #10](10.md).

## Our solution

We chose to simply include prebuilt binaries for now. To build `Social.Xaml`,
run this command in Developer Command Prompt from `/deps/WinObjC/`:

```cmd
msbuild "/t:WinObjC Frameworks Package\Social_Xaml\dll\Social_Xaml" /p:BuildProjectReferences=false /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x86 /v:m .\build\build.sln
```

`UIKit.Xaml` can be built similarly. Note that you may need to have already
built `WinObjC` (since there is option `/p:BuildProjectReferences=false`). See
[our notes about WinObjC](../winobjc.md) for more information about that.

Also note that there's no `/p:ObjC_Port=true` present and therefore, the
original version will be built. This means that it won't link
`dyld_initializer.cpp`, `libdyld.dll` nor `libobjc.dll`. It's probably OK for
these XAML projects and it has the added bonus that we don't have to copy those
DLLs.
