# `#2`: [build] Building our project with patched Clang as its dependency

First, we build the patched Clang using *original* Clang.
Then, we would like to use that patched Clang in the rest of the project.

## Approach A

One idea is to first set `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` to the original Clang (before CMake runs compiler tests) and then to the patched one (after `project` directive, where the compiler tests are run).
This works unless there are no subprojects (where the compiler tests would run again).
Also, don't use `CACHE PATH "" FORCE` as it changes cache which needs to be deleted when CMake is re-run and therefore superbuild is re-run, too, even if we are not in the superbuild's directory.
