# `#17`: [woc] Using `pthreads-win32` library

We want to use a single `pthread` implementation. So we build `pthreads-win32`
ourselves (see `/src/pthread/`). But WinObjC originally used its own prebuilt
`pthread.dll` which comes with its own set of headers. And since we link against
our `pthread.dll`, we must also use our headers.
