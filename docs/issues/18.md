# `#18`: [woc] Bridge types in `+initialize`

## Introduction

Some CoreFoundation and Foundation types are bridged together (e.g., `NSArray`
and `CFArray`). This is done by calling function `_CFRuntimeBridgeTypeToClass`.

Originally, this bridging function was called from `+load` method of the
corresponding Foundation class (e.g., `NSArray`). This was implemented for many
such pairs of classes by macro `BRIDGED_CLASS_REQUIRED_IMPLS`.

## Problem

If the bridge is not set, it can cause trouble. And the bridge may not be set if
some Foundation class calls some bridged Foundation class from its `+load`
method.

As a concrete example, consider class `NSURLProtocol_file`. It calls some
`NSURLProtocol`'s method from its `+load` method. `NSURLProtocol` in turns tries
to create an instance of `NSMutableArray`. But if `NSURLProtocol`'s `+load`
method is called before `NSMutableArray`'s one, `NSMutableArray` will be
unbridged, causing its initialization to fail.

## Solution

There's another method similar to `+load`. It's called `+initialize` and the
Objective-C runtime calls it before sending any message to the object that
defines it.

Therefore, it's ideal to bridge classes inside `+initialize` instead of `+load`
method.
